TEST
Rewrite test with better factories

Extend test for products that contain subproducts
Create test cases for an order with a lote. Check final price.

UI
Refactor product dialog to be able to add lotes (product with subproducts)

REFACTOR
See design patterns ruby for creating a helper that prints?
current to_s in product works nicely.

SMALL IMPROVEMENTS
Columns can be manually extended, but extend automatically based on content?
Order products when header is pressed
Validate csv files when importing

ISSUES
If orders table is empty, presing the header causes a crash

A product might contain line_items instead of products cause I need to specify quantity or weight
when creating lotes.

Indeed it will contain subproducts through line_items. (Ignore line_items prices in parent product. Parent product has a fixed price)
Re-write associations accordingly, and continue with the UI when creating new product with subproducts.
Re-write test for new associations.
