- Avoid deleting products that ara in an order but mark them as 'outdated'
	Create attribute in Products called outdated that marks it as or being available or not.
	On the other hand, you can edit the price, name, iva, etc ... of a product and orders previously created
	will not change their values cause they are saved when the order is created.

	Create test for those scenarios  

- refactor product table. Create button to mark a product as out of order.
	- Only price
  	- Add EUR, %, etc to views.

- when creating new products, (product_dialog) misses price_type combobox


Small improvements
Columns can be manually extended, but extend automatically based on content?
Order products when header is pressed
Hide columns id (hide them and don't delete them since they are needed to get objects)
Validate csv files when importing 
If orders table is empty, presing the header causes a crash

TODO
rewrite text properly using fixtures or factory_girl.
