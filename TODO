Rewrite line_items_dialog to return a LineItem object with its children built
instead of returning a hash.
The new dialogs for subitems should return a LineItem filled with subitems without being
saved into the database

Create test for Tokenizer helper functions
Continue TDD in last product_spec (implementing order.to_s)
Rename associations in product?

Test new associations accordingly.
Continue with the UI when creating new product with subproducts.

Extend test for products that contain subproducts
Create test cases for an order with a lote. Check final price.

UI
Refactor product dialog to be able to add lotes (product with subproducts)

REFACTOR
See design patterns ruby for creating a helper that prints?
current to_s in product works nicely.

SMALL IMPROVEMENTS
Columns can be manually extended, but extend automatically based on content?
Order products when header is pressed
Validate csv files when importing

ISSUES
If orders table is empty, presing the header causes a crash
