line items do not sum properly on order view (1+2 soca => 3 soca!!) 

Continue with LineItemsTable
A product needs weight or not (handle it in line item dialog to enable or not the weight!!)

Run bundle install to generate ctags and load them in sublime

Small improvements
Columns can be manually extended, but extend automatically based on content?
Order products when header is pressed
Hide columns id (hide them and don't delete them since they are needed to get objects)
Validate csv files when importing 
If orders table is empty, presing the header causes a crash
