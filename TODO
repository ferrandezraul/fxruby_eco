- Remove ENUMS and use just a hash.
  EXCHANGE_RATES = { "USD_TO_DKK" => 6 }
  COLUMN = { :name => { :position => 0, :tittle => 'Name' },
            :address => { :position => 1, :tittle => 'Address' } }

- refactor product table. Create button to delete current selected product.
- when creating new products, (product_dialog) misses price_type combobox
- Add EUR, %, etc to views.

Small improvements
Columns can be manually extended, but extend automatically based on content?
Order products when header is pressed
Hide columns id (hide them and don't delete them since they are needed to get objects)
Validate csv files when importing 
If orders table is empty, presing the header causes a crash

TODO
rewrite text properly using fixtures or factory_girl.
