Continue with test
	create customers_csv_builder.rb and its test
	
Fix bug, multiple line items not displayed in order view
Handle reject in dialogs --> call dastroy?

It might be worth to check examples in gem fxryby/examples (table)
Use FXPopup and FXOption instead of combobox?? Do they support custom data?
See example groupbox.rb

1. line items do not sum properly on order view (1+2 soca => 3 soca!!)
2. refactor product table. Create button to delete current selected product.
3. when creating new products, (product_dialog) misses price_type combobox
4. Add EUR, %, etc to views.
5. When creating an order and one line item is selected, date and customer should be fixed/disabled

Small improvements
Columns can be manually extended, but extend automatically based on content?
Order products when header is pressed
Hide columns id (hide them and don't delete them since they are needed to get objects)
Validate csv files when importing 
If orders table is empty, presing the header causes a crash
