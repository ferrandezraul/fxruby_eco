Extend test for products that contain subproducts
Create test cases for an order with a lote. Check final price.

UI
Refactor product dialog to be able to add lotes (product with subproducts)

REFACTOR
See design patterns ruby for creating a helper that prints?
current to_s in product works nicely.

SMALL IMPROVEMENTS
Columns can be manually extended, but extend automatically based on content?
Order products when header is pressed
Validate csv files when importing

ISSUES
If orders table is empty, presing the header causes a crash
