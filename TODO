Implement composite pattern for lotes
http://stackoverflow.com/questions/17603142/implementing-the-composite-pattern-in-ruby-on-rails

In order to implement a lote, I need to change associations (Use ancestry gem)
Continue with test for ancestry

Create test for this. 

Small improvements
Columns can be manually extended, but extend automatically based on content?
Order products when header is pressed
Validate csv files when importing 
If orders table is empty, presing the header causes a crash
